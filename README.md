# ASP.NET Core Instagram Integration Example

## Overview

This repository demonstrates an example of integrating an ASP.NET Core application with Instagram. The project showcases how to interact with the Instagram API to access user profiles, fetch media, and interact with social content. The aim of this project is to provide a working example for developers who want to learn how to integrate Instagram's capabilities into their ASP.NET Core applications.

## Why We're Doing It

Integrating with Instagram is useful for a wide variety of use cases, such as:

- Showcasing user-generated content on your website
- Displaying an Instagram feed for businesses or personal brands
- Building dashboards that analyze Instagram engagement metrics
- Developing marketing automation or scheduling tools

This project serves as a learning resource for developers who want to understand how to use Instagram's Graph API and implement OAuth2-based authentication in ASP.NET Core applications.

## What This Project Covers

This example project demonstrates how to:

- Authenticate users via Instagram using OAuth2
- Retrieve basic profile information of authenticated users
- Fetch a user's media feed, including photos, videos, and captions
- Display Instagram content in a web application built with ASP.NET Core
- Handle errors and rate limits while interacting with the Instagram API

## Technologies Used

This project leverages the following technologies and frameworks:

- **ASP.NET Core**: The primary framework for building the web application.
- **Instagram Graph API**: The official API to interact with Instagram data.
- **OAuth 2.0**: The authentication protocol used to securely connect to Instagram on behalf of users.
- **Bootstrap**: A front-end framework for styling the application.
- **Entity Framework Core**: For handling database interactions, if needed.
- **Azure or AWS**: The cloud platform to host the application (optional).
